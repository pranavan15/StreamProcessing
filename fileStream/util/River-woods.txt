OVER THE RIVER AND THROUGH THE WOODS

Over the river and through the woods to Grandmotherâ€™s house we go. The horse knows
the way to carry the sleigh through the white and drifted snow. Over the river and
through the woods, oh, how the wind does blow! It stings the toes and bites the nose as
over the ground we go.
