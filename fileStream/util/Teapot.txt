I’M A LITTLE TEAPOT/ I’M A LITTLE SNOWMAN

I’m a little teapot short and stout. Here is my handle, here is my spout. When the water’s
boiling, hear me shout, “Tip me over, pour me out!”
I’m a little teapot short and stout. Here is my handle, here is my spout. I can change my
handle or my spout. “Tip me over, pour me out!”
I’m a little snowman, short and fat. Here is my broomstick, here is my hat. When the
jolly sunshine comes to stay. Then I slowly melt away!
